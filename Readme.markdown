Bonsai raytracer
================

This is my personal toy raytracer, to keep me from getting bored with my
other projects. It should render to HDR, be photorealistic and
[-Ofun](http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2005/10/ofun.html).

I also use a few parts of it as school projects.

You donâ€™t want to use it (yet).
The code is full of bugs, server is crap and it does only trivial shading
(everything is either completely black or completely white).
... but one day it will become the coolest and greatest (and fastest)
renderer around.
Or maybe not.
