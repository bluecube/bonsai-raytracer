Bonsai is my raytracer project to relax from other programming :-)

What it should do:
- be multi-threaded
- be distrbuted (running on multiple hosts)
- support true DOF.
- maybe support spectral rendering
- render in HDR
- Currently I'm not trying to support motion blur or video rendering.
- look cool
- be simple


The motto is:
I don't care how long it takes, as long as the pictures are pretty.
...and also -Ofun
