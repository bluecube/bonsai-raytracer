Bonsai is my raytracer project to relax from other programming :-)

What it should do:
- be multi-threaded
- be distrbuted (running on multiple hosts)
- be distributing (models the illumination equation
  by distributing a set of ray from every reflection/refraction).
- support true DOF.
- render in HDR and export to HDR.
- Currently I'm not trying to support motion blur or video rendering.
- I try to speed things up by using KD trees as containers.

The motto is:
I don't care how long it takes, as long as the pictures are pretty.
...and also -Ofun
