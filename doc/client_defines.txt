DISABLE_MEASUREMENTS
	Remove the measurements code.
	It should make the rendering a tiny bit faster.
DISABLE_FAST_RANDOM_NUMBER
	Use only the slow generic code for generating random floats.
	It is a bug if the client doesn't work without this flag.
MEASUREMENTS_KD_TREE_STATS
	Render in false colors that show the statistics of KD-tree intersections
	(red channel is a number of ray-object intersection tests, green
	channel represents number of tree node traversals).
DISABLE_SSE
	Disable all the code with SSE intrinsics. The result will be slower but
	more portable.
